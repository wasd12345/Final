# Final
Final Project for CS231A

My MATLAB code:\n
MAIN - main code\n
EdgesNCC\n
GetWarpMatrix\n
TestGetWarpMatrix - not actually called in MAIN, but demonstrates that Bilinear Interpolation Matrix code is working as intended\n
IRLS
Homography2D
RANSAC_Homography2D

CCORR_NORM - Mex file to do NCC faster than MATLAB builtin

MATLAB code modified from others:
WARP
warpFL
flowToColor - for some visualizes that I never really used.
computeColor - for some visualizes that I never really used.
